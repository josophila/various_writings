From the charophyte green algae to the angiosperms, plant morphogenesis is constrained by the activity of the apical meristem. Specifically, the ability of the cell or cells constituting the apical meristem to orient their cell division planes with one, two, or three-dimensional control tracks through evolutionary history with filamentous, planar/branched filamentous, or parenchymatous morhologies, respectively. The gametophyte phase of the moss Physcomitrella patens includes a transition from two-dimensional to three-dimensional growth that is initiated by a series of oblique, asymmetric cell divisions ultimately producing a single tetrahedral cell that is the shoot (gametophore) apical meristem.
