From the charophyte green algae to the angiosperms, plant morphogenesis is constrained by the activity of the ability of the cell or cells constituting the apical meristem to orient their cell division planes. Specifically, apical cell division planes that vary in one, two, or three-dimensions control permit filamentous, planar/branched filamentous, or parenchymatous morhologies, respectively. The gametophyte phase of the moss Physcomitrella patens includes a transition from two-dimensional to three-dimensional growth that is initiated by a series of oblique, asymmetric cell divisions in a bud ultimately producing a single tetrahedral cell that is the shoot apical meristem (SAM). This cell continuously grows and divides to pattern leaf (phyllid) poisitioning while replenshing itself throughou the development of the shoot, equivalent in function to an angiosperm SAM.
