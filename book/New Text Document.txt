She sat down on a large rounded rock and took a breath for what felt like the first time that day.  She looked slowly all around her, using this moment in the air to take in what she saw.  The desert, with its crusted land, the plants that managed to grow on that land, and the animals that survived, eating the plants.  Farther away, the village was visible, and the people there were preparing small fires for the evening.  The land, the plants, the animals, and then us, she thought.  Us, who lived, burrowing into the ground, uprooting the plants, and hunting for the animals. 

She wondered how it could all add up - that this land must have supported a small amount of life already without a village full of people taking what they too needed to survive.  But somehow it worked, the Emorab have lived here for thousands of years now it was said, and it's been working for this long.  

A breeze stirred the twilight air, and brought with it the sounds of voices, dishes, and laughter from the village.  She smiled, looked up at the sky, so depleted now of blue and full instead of reds, greens, and pinks.  She breathed deeply, stood up, and walked back to the village.
