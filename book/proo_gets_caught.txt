	One day, he caught me.  I was prowling the streets, looking for an easy take, business as usual.  Sure, he was a big guy, and kind of scary looking, but he also looked like a  stiff and smelled like a mark.  And I was desparate.  I found out later that I couldn't have been more wrong.  Have you heard of those flowers with smells that bring insects in real close, and then 'whap', the plant traps the insect? This guy, he was like that, but he could make any scent in the book. More about that later, though.
	
	So anyway, I spot him, lumbering around town, looking lost.  I inch towards him over the span of a few blocks, and then up close, man do I really get an appreciation for how big this lump is, but his clothes are of oh-so-nice a quality and I'm thinking he must be getting tired, carrying so much valuables all day, so why don't I help take some weight off the poor guy, and I'm there hurting bad for a night at the houses.  Who knows, maybe that clouded my judgement a little. 
	
	Up ahead there's a crowd: a bunch of people stuck waiting for a caravan to clear out of the street so they can make their way across. The sad, tied up girls in at the houses flash through my head and I feel sick... my heart is sinking, my stomach churning, and dick is heavy - I'm full of anticipation and disgust becauseI know it's too late -- there's no turning back now that I've thought of them, seen them in my head. They're clouding me up with the way they look, I'm full of the way they feel, the way they smell.  I hate them and I hate myself, and so I decide that it's now or never.
